##  Key Implementation Details

###  Efficient State Management

```typescript
// Only current page data is stored - prevents memory issues
const [artworksOnPage, setArtworksOnPage] = useState<Artwork[]>([]);

// Selection stored as Record<id, Artwork> for O(1) lookup
const [selectionState, setSelectionState] = useState<Record<number, Artwork>>({});
```

###  Server-Side Pagination

```typescript
// API called on every page change
useEffect(() => {
  fetchArtworksForPage(currentPage + 1);
}, [currentPage]);
```

###  Persistent Selection Logic

- Selections stored in a **Record/Dictionary** structure indexed by artwork ID
- When page changes, only current page data is updated
- Selection state remains intact, providing persistence
- Active selections filtered from current page for display

### Custom Bulk Selection

- Users can input any quantity (e.g., 20 rows)
- System fetches multiple pages if needed
- Toggles selection/deselection intelligently
- Prevents memory overflow by not storing all fetched data

###  URL State Management

```typescript
// Page state persisted in URL
const url = new URL(window.location.href);
url.searchParams.set("page", (e.page + 1).toString());
window.history.pushState({}, "", url);
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading** - Only fetches data for the current page
2. **Efficient Re-renders** - Minimal state updates using useEffect dependencies
3. **Optimized Selection Lookup** - O(1) selection checks using Record structure
4. **API Call Optimization** - Debounced and controlled API requests
5. **Memory Management** - No accumulation of data from previous pages
